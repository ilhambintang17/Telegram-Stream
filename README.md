    A High-Performance Telegram File Streaming & Direct Download Bot with Premium Web UI.
</p>

## What's New (v2.0) 🌟

This project has been massively overhauled with a focus on **User Experience** and **Reliability**:

*   **🎨 Premium Glassmorphism UI**: 
    *   Modern, Dark-themed interface using **TailwindCSS**.
    *   Fully responsive: **Full-width video player** on mobile, optimized layouts for desktop.
    *   Beautiful **Series Playlists** with thumbnails and part grouping.

*   **📺 Advanced Video Player**: 
    *   Integrated **Plyr.js** for a generic, powerful playback experience.
    *   **Custom Skip Controls**: `-10m`, `-1m`, `-10s`, `+10s`, `+1m`, `+10m` buttons for precise navigation.
    *   **Smart Thumbnails**: Automatically fetches and displays video thumbnails from Telegram.
    *   **External Players**: One-click deep links to **MX Player** and **VLC**.

*   **⚡ Core Performance & Reliability**:
    *   **Anti-FloodWait System**: Implemented a **Multi-Client Rotation System**. If a bot account hits Telegram's FloodWait limit, the system *automatically* switches to the next available client (`MULTI_TOKEN`) to continue the download seamlessly.
    *   **Direct Download**: Robust download system that serves files directly from the server (checking cache first) or streams from Telegram.
    *   **Pagination**: Smoothly browse channels with thousands of files using page-based navigation.
    *   **Duplicate Handling**: Smartly filters duplicate usages of the same video in series lists.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

*   **Backend**: Python (Aiohttp, Flask-style routing), Pyrogram (Telegram Client).
*   **Database**: MongoDB (Metadata & Session management).
*   **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS, **TailwindCSS** (CDN), **Plyr.js**.
*   **Hosting**: Heroku, VPS, or Docker.

### ***Multiple Bots*** 🚀 (Speed Booster)

> [!NOTE]
> **What it multi-client feature and what it does?** <br><br>
> This feature shares the Telegram API requests between worker bots to speed up download speed when many users are using the server and to avoid the flood limits that are set by Telegram. <br>

> [!NOTE]
> You can add up to 50 bots since 50 is the max amount of bot admins you can set in a Telegram Channel.

To enable multi-client, generate new bot tokens and add it as your `config.env` with the following key names. 

`MULTI_TOKEN1`: Add your first bot token here.
`MULTI_TOKEN2`: Add your second bot token here.

you may also add as many as bots you want. (max limit is 50)
`MULTI_TOKEN3`, `MULTI_TOKEN4`, etc.

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to add all these worker bots to the `AUTH_CHANNEL` for the proper functioning


### ***Generate Database*** 💾

> [!NOTE]
> **Why Database is Required** <br><br>
> In Playlist Creator, the folder and file data are stored. As of now, the session string is not required in Surf-TG, so to store these files, the database is necessary. <br>


1. Go to `https://mongodb.com/` and sign-up.
2. Create Shared Cluster.
3. Press on `Database` under `Deployment` Header, your created cluster will be there.
5. Press on connect, choose `Allow Access From Anywhere` and press on `Add IP Address` without editing the ip, then
   create user.
6. After creating user press on `Choose a connection`, then press on `Connect your application`. Choose `Driver` 
   **python** and `version` **3.6 or later**.
7. Copy your `connection string` and replace `<password>` with the password of your user, then press close.

### Generate Session String 

> [!NOTE]
> **Make Sure that you have to Generate the `Pyrofork Session String`**

To generate the Session String use this [Colab Tool](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F3cRAdgvFSenOoVSxJFxP-356pE4sWOL)

## FAQ 🤔


#### Question 1: Is a session string required in Surf-TG?

**Answer:** No, it is not required.

#### Question 2: I am using Surf-TG without a session string, but my channel files are not showing on the web.

**Answer:** To initially index your files, use the `/index` command in `AUTH_CHANNEL`. This command stores all your files in the database. Please ensure that you use the `/index` command only in one channel at a time. Once the channel indexing is complete, you can proceed to index the next channel.

#### Question 3: Do I need to use the `/index` command every time the bot restarts or is deployed again?

**Answer:** No, whether you restart the bot or deploy it again, you don't need to perform initial indexing unless you change the database.

#### Question 4: Do I have to use the `/index` command every time I upload a file to the channel to index it?

**Answer:** No, the `/index` command is only used once initially. Subsequently, any files you send will automatically be stored in the database.

#### Question 5: When will be the cache system work?
**Answer:** It work only when you use the `Session String.`

#### Question 6: How are posts updated on the web when using Session String?

**Answer:** Login with `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, then clicking the reload option in the Homepage navbar clears all channel caches, to showing new posts. To clear a specific channel's cache, open the channel and click its reload option.

#### Question 7: How to change theme and add/remove Channel without restart?

**Answer:** Login with `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, then clicking the Edit option in the Homepage navbar from there you can change theme and add/remove channel. Make sure that channel must be seperated by `,`

#### Question 8: Can anyone create or edit folders/files in Playlist Creator?

**Answer:** No, only admins with `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` can log in to Playlist Creator.

#### Question 9: If i delete the mongoDb database then my playlist also deleted?
